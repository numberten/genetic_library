Brief test after finishing first working version.

With a geneSize of 4 and a chromosomeSize of 5, and a fitness function that assigns 5 fitness for every 1, so only a chromosome of all 1's will past the fitness check.

Same test as before, with total population fitness output.
With an equal likelihood of 1s and 0s, initial total fitness should be about 5000.
